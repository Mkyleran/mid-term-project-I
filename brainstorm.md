# Features to consider regarding sampling distribution
- data from
    - week number
    - weekday/weekend
    - airport
        - dest
        - origin
    - carrier
    - tailnumber?
   
## Kaggle

[Data Science Final Project Course](https://www.kaggle.com/davidzaltsman/data-science-final-project-course)

 - This notebook was a binary classification predictor of flight delay.
   - Used Decision Tree, Random Forest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoostClassifier
     - RandomForest highest test accuracy = 0.80 f1 = 0.79, acc = 0.84 after tuning
     - Decision tree was marginally better than gradient boost
     - AdaBoost worst performance, accuracy, precision, and recall were all 0.66
 

[Predicting flight delay based on multiple linear regression](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/81/1/012198)

- 80% accuracy
- Naive-Bayes
- C4.5 approach

 Most flight delay prediction models I am seeing treat it as a classification problem.
